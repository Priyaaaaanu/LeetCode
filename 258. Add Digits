If sum of digits is 9 then the given number is divisible by 9. 
Also larger numbers like 99 because 9 + 9 = 18, and then 1 + 8 = 9 still, 
so the 'digital root' always becomes 9 for any numbers divisible by 9.

Additionally, 0 always has a digital root of 0 obviously.

other than 0 ans 9 !!!

So for any number that isn't 0 and isn't divisible by 9, the root will always n % 9 for a given number n. 
(the difference between given number n and the nearest number that is divisible by 9, 
since numbers divisible by 9 always have a digital root of 9).
For examples: 100 % 9 = 1 (one greater than 99, which is divisible by 9).
101 % 9 = 2
102 % 9 = 3 and so on.

class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        if(num==0) return 0;
        else if(num%9 == 0) return 9;
        else return num%9;
    }
}
